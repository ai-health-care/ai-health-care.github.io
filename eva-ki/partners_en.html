									The <b>Technische Universität Darmstadt</b> is an international center of excellence in AI research (https://www.ai-da.tu-darmstadt.de/). The university is part of the renowned "European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)". Within the framework of the AI-DA, the research group of Dr. Mukhopadhyay is concerned with the secure and interpretable implementation of AI in healthcare. His research has received several renowned international prizes, among others by RSNA and MICCAI. Prof. Fellner is a leading scientist in the field of graphics and data visualization. As a leader of several Fraunhofer Institutes, he brings the experience of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in connecting academic research and industry.
